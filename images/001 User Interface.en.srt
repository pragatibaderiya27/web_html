00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,460
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:21,270
Welcome to your fast radio, but I wouldn't be talking about the v.C interface of Adobe Illustrator.

3
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,390
Right.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,380
So Venu forced open your software.

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,640
This is the screen.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,020
You would be welcome to it.

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:38,000
So the first thing you actually notice after welcome to Illustrator, it seems that you have to create

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,800
a new file.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:40,870
Right.

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,530
So what this means is that you have to give dimensions.

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:53,610
All feel in your document on your document is your blank white page where you will be designing, audit

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,760
it all your illustrations.

13
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:04,310
Now, these illustrations can be either be used on your shots or your Mumbai Garbo's or on Mudd's or

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:12,140
even designed logos for your brand and even you and you when design GUI, log beaches, magazine, beaches,

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,510
bookstores, etc..

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,550
Right.

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:22,610
So if you need to choose from one of these documents right here, which are already being preloaded,

18
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,650
it can be off any size.

19
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,860
It can be a size of a postcard.

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:36,170
And even if you want to design and illustrate Dover, you can view on your phone the document can be

21
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,290
of this size as well.

22
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:46,100
But in case, if you want to also customize your document, even Fordo, you usually go to create new.

23
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:57,680
So as you can see right here, I do realize estate provides a much, much bigger good idea of these

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,200
documents right here.

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,270
So feel free to choose any of these documents ises as you please.

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,940
Feel free to even explore more options from Hill.

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:18,350
So the size is getting V.T. from any size, do any good people size, A4 size, Aletta letterhead,

28
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,630
tabloid format.

29
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,340
It's quite a lot.

30
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,140
But for this, where do I will be sticking to?

31
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:36,380
I will be sticking to this standard A4 size document, which is twenty one centimeters in weight and

32
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,140
twenty nine point seven centimeters in height.

33
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,710
So by default, in my laptop the unit of measurement is centimeters.

34
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,660
So in your screen it can be initially different.

35
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:57,380
Does what it might mean because all fixes or even inches it can maybe.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,230
Okay here are instead of untied dude.

37
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,390
Let's also give a name to our document.

38
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,060
So let's Niemi Elias creation.

39
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,690
And here are the orientation part is basically how you want to use your document.

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,820
Do you want to do be in portrait format or do you want to do being landscape.

41
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,500
So it's up to you.

42
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:37,260
And over here are the art boards that sees and we are in the art board finder.

43
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:37,610
Right.

44
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,130
So it sees one that means only one document to a view or will be open.

45
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,570
When you only one document will be open for you to design.

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,900
I took a course, but you could always increase the number of outboards your.

47
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,200
Or it district to one.

48
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,820
And then we click on Clear.

49
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,520
And there you go.

50
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:17,340
This white Blankley's that you'll see is your documentary and you will be designing orda all your illustrations.

51
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:25,560
But in case, if you guys are unable to see all these that idea, it's probably because in short, in

52
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,640
this essential classic option at all.

53
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,580
Right.

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,410
So doing what if you aren't just click on this dropdown box below and click essentially classic.

55
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,560
So once you do that, all the tools you see right here will be shown.

56
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,910
OK.

57
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,680
So now let's begin.

58
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:52,500
So on your left hand side of your screen, all these tools you see right here are the mean do is that

59
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,520
we designed those.

60
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,180
You was 95 percent off.

61
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,760
Right.

62
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:04,590
So if you've seen those squawky designs up on finches, you've you seen mandalas or those complicated

63
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,060
gaited designs are used from these dudes.

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,440
Most of the times.

65
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,410
Right.

66
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:19,350
So moving ahead on the doc menu over here are all the other two words.

67
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:19,970
Red.

68
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,430
Right.

69
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:30,270
You can use to either to to your shape or if you want to add a particular type of effect you can to

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,690
choose any of these effects from your.

71
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,080
So if you want to change stuff fell off your collar.

72
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,950
So if you want to change the feel of your sheep, you can choose from these with ideal variety of colors,

73
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,630
a tail.

74
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,000
So this is the stroke.

75
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,200
The stroke is basically the outline of your sheet.

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,910
Right.

77
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:02,010
And over here are the short reed determines the intensity of your outline.

78
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,990
So by default, it's one that means the outline of your sheep will be extremely eaten.

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,190
So the higher the value of your stalk meat, the more tick I outline is going to be.

80
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,140
Right.

81
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,060
I know where you are on your right hand side of your screen.

82
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,440
Awesome.

83
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:30,370
Additional two words which are equally important for us designers to create all that illustrations.

84
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,500
Right.

85
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,480
So I will be discussing about these two with more in depth in the other videos as well.

86
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:46,450
But for now, as you can see, an audio design and illustration, you can control the John SPAD and

87
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:53,260
see from yo, you can decide how you going decide the opacity from your controller.

88
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,030
You can add different kinds of some votes from your even and even choose the type of brush size you

89
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,740
want from the from the brush to.

90
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:02,980
Right.

91
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,270
Right.

92
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,200
So this was it.

93
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:15,240
This was like the most basic introduction of the interface.

94
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,640
And that's about it.

95
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,340
So thank you for watching.

96
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,730
And I will see you again very soon.
